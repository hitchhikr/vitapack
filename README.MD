An experimental packer aiming to produce very small .vpk for the PlayStation Vita.

It takes a .velf file created by vita-elf-create
(preferably the .tmp stripped version that this tool produces with the -s option)
as input and outputs a .vpk of the smallest size possible.

https://github.com/nih-at/libzip/ is required to compile it.
